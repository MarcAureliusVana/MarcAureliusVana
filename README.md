Hello world, I’m @MarcAureliusVana. I’m interested in web technologies like HTML & CSS / SASS, JavaScript, React. I am a persevering and ambitious student currently at the National College "Emil Racovita" Cluj-Napoca, Romania. I love working with people who share the same interests with me and I'm an adaptive person who can work as much as it needs to get the things done. I'm currently developing my web portfolio to contain more and more creative projects made with these web technologies. I learn every day something new and that alone just amazes me.

Anyhow, I participated several years at the National Olympiad of Informatics, from where I got used to advanced algorithmic and competitive programming. I coded in C++, but I also know intermediate level Python (a bit of Machine Learning & Deep Learning).

For any questions, feel free to contact me at marcvana.web@gmail.com. After my portfolio website will be online, you'll reach me more easily from there. I am open to partnerships, internships and jobs.
